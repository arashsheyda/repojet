## Features

- **Search repositories** across multiple GitHub organizations
- **Bookmark repositories** to keep them at the top of your list
- **Clone repositories** directly to your local machine with one command
- **Customizable clone directory** - choose where repos are cloned
- Support for private repositories with GitHub Personal Access Token
- Real-time search with instant results
- Quick access to repository URLs and clone commands

## Setup

### 1. Install the Extension

The extension is located in the `raycast-extension` directory.

### 2. Configure GitHub Token (Optional but Recommended)

To access private repositories and increase API rate limits:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name like "Raycast Kong Extension"
4. Select the `repo` scope, this grants:
   - Full control of private repositories (read access)
   - Access to repository metadata
   - Read access to organization repositories
5. Set an appropriate expiration date (recommended: 90 days or less for security)
6. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
7. **Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
8. **For SSO-enabled organizations**: After creating the token, you must authorize it for each organization:
   - Go to [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click on your newly created token
   - Under "Configure SSO", click **Authorize** next to each organization you want to search
   - This step is required for accessing repositories in organizations with SAML SSO enabled

**Security Note**: This extension only requires read access. The token validation will reject tokens with dangerous write/admin scopes like `delete_repo`, `workflow`, `admin:org`, or `write:repo_hook`.

### 3. Add Organizations

1. Open Raycast
2. Search for "GitHub Organization Search" → "Search Repositories"
3. If not configured, you'll see setup instructions
4. Open Preferences (⌘,)
5. Paste your GitHub token in "GitHub Personal Access Token"
6. Enter your organization names (comma-separated) in "GitHub Organizations"
   - Example: `myorg1, myorg2, personal-org`
7. (Optional) Set your preferred "Clone Directory" for cloning repositories
   - Default: `~/Developer`
   - You can use paths like `~/Projects`, `~/Code`, or any absolute path

### 4. Start Searching

Search for repositories by name, description, or language!

## Usage

1. Open Raycast (default: `⌘Space`)
2. Type "Search Repositories" and hit Enter
3. Type to search (e.g., "react", "api", "database")
4. Results show:
   - Repository name and description
   - Star count
   - Programming language
   - Privacy status (if private)
   - Bookmark indicator (yellow star) for bookmarked repos
5. Available actions:
   - **Enter** - Open repository in browser
   - **⌘D** - Clone repository to your configured directory
   - **⌘B** - Bookmark/unbookmark repository (bookmarked repos stay at the top)
   - **⌘C** - Copy repository URL
   - **⌘⇧C** - Copy git clone URL

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘D** - Clone repository to local machine
- **⌘B** - Toggle bookmark (keeps repos at the top)
- **⌘C** - Copy repository URL
- **⌘⇧C** - Copy git clone URL
- **⌘,** - Open preferences

## Authentication

The extension uses GitHub's REST API v3. Authentication is optional but recommended:

- **Without token**: Limited to public repositories, 60 requests/hour
- **With token (classic PAT)**: Access to private repositories, 5,000 requests/hour

### Token Requirements
- Must be a **Personal Access Token (classic)**
- Required scope: `repo` (for private repository access)
- Token will be validated for security - tokens with dangerous write/admin scopes will be rejected

## Example Queries

- `react` - Find React-related repositories
- `database` - Find database-related repositories
- `language:python` - Find Python repositories
- `stars:>1000` - Find popular repositories
- `is:private` - Find private repositories (requires token)

## Rate Limiting

GitHub API has rate limits:
- Without token: 60 requests/hour
- With token: 5,000 requests/hour

The extension caches results, so repeated searches are instant.

## Troubleshooting

### No results found
- Check that your organizations are spelled correctly
- Ensure the GitHub token is valid (if using private repos)
- Try simpler search terms

### "API rate limit exceeded"
- Add a GitHub Personal Access Token to increase limits
- Wait an hour for the limit to reset

### Can't access private repositories
- Ensure your token is a **Personal Access Token (classic)** with `repo` scope
- **For SSO organizations**: Make sure you've authorized the token for SSO access to each organization (see step 8 in setup)
- Token might have expired (regenerate if needed)
- Check that you have access to the organizations you're searching
